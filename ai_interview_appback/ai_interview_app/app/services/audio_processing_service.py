# app/services/audio_processing_service.py - Service for audio processing (Placeholder)

# This service would be responsible for converting audio data into text transcripts.
# Since the prompt mentions receiving "chunk of the sentence given to LLM, given along
# with the prompt that the sentence is not yet completed", it implies the front-end
# is handling the Speech-to-Text (STT) and sending text chunks.
# If the front-end sends raw audio chunks, this service would implement the STT logic.

# For now, this is a placeholder as the front-end seems to handle transcription.

class AudioProcessingService:
    """
    Handles Speech-to-Text if the backend is responsible for transcription.
    Assumes client sends text chunks based on prompt description.
    """
